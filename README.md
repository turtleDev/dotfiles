# Dotfiles

from [wiki][linux-config]

>  In computing, configuration files, or config files configure the parameters
   and initial settings for some computer programs. [...] 
   System-wide software often uses configuration files stored in /etc, while
   user applications often use a "dotfile" - a file or directory in the home
   directory prefixed with a period, which in Unix hides the file or directory
   from casual listing.
